nunchaku
	A nunchaku is two sections of wood (or metal in modern
	incarnations) connected by a cord or chain.  There is much
	controversy over its origins; some say it was originally a
	Chinese weapon, others say it evolved from a threshing flail;
	one theory purports that it was developed from a horse's bit.
	Chinese nunchaku tend to be rounded, whereas Japanese are
	octagonal, and they were originally linked by horse hair.
	There are many variations on the nunchaku, ranging from the
	three sectional staff (san-setsu-kon nunchaku), to smaller
	multi-section nunchaku.  The nunchaku was popularized by
	Bruce Lee in a number of films, made in both Hollywood and
	Hong Kong.
