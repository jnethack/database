	These strange creatures live mostly on the surface of the
	earth, gathering together in societies of various forms, but
	occasionally a stray will descend into the depths and commit
	mayhem among the dungeon residents who, naturally, often
	resent the intrusion of such beasts.  They are capable of
	using weapons and magic, and it is even rumored that the
	Wizard of Yendor is a member of this species.
