grid bug
	These electronically based creatures are not native to this
	universe.  They appear to come from a world whose laws of
	motion are radically different from ours.

	Tron looked to his mate and pilot.  "I'm going to check on
	the beam connection, Yori.  You two can keep a watch out for
	grid bugs."  Tron paced forward along the slender catwalk
	that still seemed awfully insubstantial to Flynn, though he
	knew it to be amazingly sturdy.  He gazed after Tron, asking
	himself what in the world a grid bug was, and hoping that the
	beam connection -- to which he'd given no thought whatsoever
	until this moment -- was healthy and sound."
