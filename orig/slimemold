slime mold
	Slime mold or slime fungus, organism usually classified with
	the fungi, but showing equal affinity to the protozoa.  Slime
	molds have complex life cycles with an animal-like motile
	phase, in which feeding and growth occur, and a plant-like
	immotile reproductive phase.  The motile phase, commonly
	found under rotting logs and damp leaves, consists of either
	solitary amoebalike cells or a brightly colored multinucleate
	mass of protoplasm called a plasmodium, which creeps about
	and feeds by amoeboid movement.
