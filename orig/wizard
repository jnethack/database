	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
