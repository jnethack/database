*strange object
	He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor
	without finding any one and was just going to call out,
	when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard
	and the door he caught sight of a strange object which
	seemed to be alive.
		[ Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky ]
