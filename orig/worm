	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
