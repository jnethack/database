	"Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters -- but hunters
	ever of the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many
	places, not in Mordor only.
	If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played
	another part.  Many evil things there are that your strong walls
	and bright swords do not stay.  You know little of the lands
	beyond your bounds.  Peace and freedom, do you say?  The North
	would have known them little but for us.  Fear would have
	destroyed them.  But when dark things come from the houseless
	hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us.  What
	roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there be in
	quiet lands, or in the homes of simple men at night, if the
	Dunedain were asleep, or were all gone into the grave?"
