newt
	(kinds of) small animal, like a lizard, which spends most of
	its time in the water.
		[ Oxford's Student's Dictionary of Current English ]

	"Fillet of a fenny snake,
	In the cauldron boil and bake;
	Eye of newt and toe of frog,
	Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
	Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
	Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
	For a charm of powerful trouble,
	Like a hell-broth boil and bubble."
		[ Macbeth, by William Shakespeare ]
