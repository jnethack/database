platinum yendorian express card
	This is an ancient artifact made of an unknown material.  It
	is rectangular in shape, very thin, and inscribed with
	unreadable ancient runes.  When carried, it grants the one
	who carries it ESP, and reduces all spell induced damage done to
	the carrier by half.  It also protects from magic missile
	attacks.  Finally, its power is such that when invoked, it
	can charge other objects.
