yeti
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
