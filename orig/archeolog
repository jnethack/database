	Archeology is the search for fact, not truth. [...]
	So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel,
	and digging up the world. We do not follow maps to buried
	treasure, and X never, ever, marks the spot.
		[ Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ]

	"I cannot be having with archeological excavations, myself,"
	I said.  "The fellows who dig them only ever find tiny walls
	and a few bits of broken pottery, and then they get all
	excited and swear that they have just made the most
	important discovery of the century, the ruins of a mile-high
	gold-covered temple to Frogmore the God of Bike-Saddle
	Fixtures or some such."
	"I think you will find," said Mr Rune, "that they do this
	in order to secure further government funding for their
	diggings and so remain in employment."
	"That is a rather cynical view," I said.
