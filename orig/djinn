djinn*
	The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air.  There,
	among their kind, they have their own societies.  They are
	sometimes encountered on earth and may even be summoned here
	to perform some service for powerful wizards.  The wizards
	often leave them about for later service, safely tucked away
	in a flask or lamp.  Once in a while, such a tool is found by
	a lucky rogue, and some djinn are known to be so grateful
	when released that they might grant their rescuer a wish.
