A.S*
	Presently we reached a place where the beach narrowed; the sea
	almost came up to the foot of the cliffs, leaving a passage no
	wider than a couple of yards.  Between two projecting rocks we
	caught sight of the entrance to a dark tunnel.
	There, on a slab of granite, appeared two mysterious letters,
	half eaten away by time -- the two initials of the bold,
	adventurous traveller:

			A.S.

	'A.S.,' cried my uncle. 'Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm again!'

	[...] at the sight of those two letters, carved there three
	hundred years before, I stood in utter stupefaction.  Not
	only was the signature of the learned alchemist legible on
	the rock, but I held in my hand the dagger which had traced it.
	Without showing the most appalling bad faith, I could no longer
	doubt the existence of the traveller and the reality of his
	journey.
