	Little is known about the Faceless Lord, even the correct
	spelling of his name.  He does not have a physical form as
	we know it, and those who have peered into his realm claim
	he is a slime-like creature who swallows other creatures
	alive, spits acidic secretions, and causes disease in his
	victims which can be almost instantly fatal.
