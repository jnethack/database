lizard
	Lizards, snakes and the burrowing amphisbaenids make up the
	order Squamata, meaning the scaly ones.  The elongate, slim,
	long-tailed bodies of lizards have become modified to enable
	them to live in a wide range of habitats.  Lizards can be
	expert burrowers, runners, swimmers and climbers, and a few
	can manage crude, short-distance gliding on rib-supported
	"wings".  Most are carnivores, feeding on invertebrate and
	small vertebrate prey, but others feed on vegetation.
