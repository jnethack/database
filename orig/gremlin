gremlin
	The gremlin is a highly intelligent and completely evil
	creature.  It lives to torment other creatures and will go
	to great lengths to inflict pain or cause injury.

	Suddenly, Wilson thought about war, about the newspaper
	stories which recounted the alleged existence of creatures in
	the sky who plagued the Allied pilots in their duties.  They
	called them gremlins, he remembered.  Were there, actually,
	such beings?  Did they, truly, exist up here, never falling,
	riding on the wind, apparently of bulk and weight, yet
	impervious to gravity?
	He was thinking that when the man appeared again.
