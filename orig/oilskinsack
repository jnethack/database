	Summer passed all too quickly.  On the last day of camp, Mr.
	Brickle called his counselors together and paid them what he
	owed them.  Louis received one hundred dollars - the first
	money he had ever earned.  He had no wallet and no pockets,
	so Mr. Brickle placed the money in a waterproof bag that had
	a drawstring.  He hung this moneybag around Louis' neck,
	along with the trumpet, the slate, the chalk pencil, and the
	lifesaving medal.
