*spear
javelin
	- they come together with great random, and a spear is brast,
	and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down,
	horse and man, over his horse-tail and brake his neck, and
	then the next candidate comes randoming in, and brast his
	spear, and the other man brast his shield, and down he goes,
	horse and man, over his horse-tail, and brake his neck, and
	then there's another elected, and another and another and
	still another, till the material is all used up; and when you
	come to figure up results, you can't tell one fight from
	another, nor who whipped; and as a picture of living, raging,
	roaring battle, sho! why it's pale and noiseless - just
	ghosts scuffling in a fog.  Dear me, what would this barren
	vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle? - the burning
	of Rome in Nero's time, for instance?  Why, it would merely
	say 'Town burned down; no insurance; boy brast a window,
	fireman brake his neck!'  Why, that ain't a picture!
