	I swear by Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health,
	and All-heal, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according
	to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and this
	stipulation -- to reckon him who taught me this Art equally dear
	to me as my parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve
	his necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the
	same footing as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if
	they shall wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation; and
	that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of instruction,
	I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those
	of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath
	according to the law of medicine, but to none others.  I will
	follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and
	judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain
	from whatever is deleterious and mischievous.  [...]

	PHYSICIAN, n.  One upon whom we set our hopes when ill and our
	dogs when well.
