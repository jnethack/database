	These giant amoeboid creatures look like nothing more than
	puddles of slime, but they both live and move, feeding on
	metal or wood as well as the occasional dungeon explorer to
	supplement their diet.

	But we were not on a station platform.  We were on the track ahead
	as the nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed
	tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy
	speed and driving before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the
	pallid abyss vapor.  It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster
	than any subway train -- a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic
	bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes
	forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the
	tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic
	penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its
	kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.
