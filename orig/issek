issek
	Now Issek of the Jug, whom Fafhrd chose to serve, was once
	of the most lowly and unsuccessful of the gods, godlets
	rather, in Lankhmar.  He had dwelt there for about thirteen
	years, during which time he had traveled only two squares up
	the Street of the Gods and was now back again, ready for
	oblivion.  He is not to be confused with Issek the Armless,
	Issek of the Burnt Legs, Flayed Issek, or any other of the
	numerous and colorfully mutilated divinities of that name.
	Indeed, his unpopularity may have been due in part to the
	fact that the manner of his death -- racking -- was not
	deemed particularly spectacular. ... However, after Fafhrd
	became his acolyte, things somehow began to change.
