*sceptre of might
	This mace was created aeons ago in some unknown cave,
	and has been passed down from generation to generation of
	cave dwellers.  It is a very mighty mace indeed, and in
	addition will protect anyone who carries it from magic
	missile attacks.  When invoked, it causes conflict in the
	area around it.
