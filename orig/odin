odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
