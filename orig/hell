gehenn*
*h?nnom
hell
	"Place of Torment."  The Valley of Hinnom, south-west of
	Jerusalem, where Solomon, king of Israel, built "a high place",
	or place of worship, for the gods Chemosh and Moloch.  The
	valley came to be regarded as a place of abomination because
	some of the Israelites sacrificed their children to Moloch
	there.  In a later period it was made a refuse dump and
	perpetual fires were maintained there to prevent pestilence.
	Thus, in the New Testament, Gehenna became synonymous with hell.
