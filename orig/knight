knight
* knight
	Here lies the noble fearless knight,
	Whose valour rose to such a height;
	When Death at last had struck him down,
	His was the victory and renown.
	He reck'd the world of little prize,
	And was a bugbear in men's eyes;
	But had the fortune in his age
	To live a fool and die a sage.
		[ Don Quixote of La Mancha, by Miquel de
		  Cervantes Saavedra ]
