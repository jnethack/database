*boot*
	In Fantasyland these are remarkable in that they seldom or
	never wear out and are suitable for riding or walking in
	without the need of Socks.  Boots never pinch, rub, or get
	stones in them; nor do nails stick upwards into the feet from
	the soles.  They are customarily mid-calf length or knee-high,
	slip on and off easily and never smell of feet.  Unfortunately,
	the formula for making this splendid footwear is a closely
	guarded secret, possibly derived from nonhumans (see Dwarfs,
	Elves, and Gnomes).
