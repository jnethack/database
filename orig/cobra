cobra
	Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without
	answering, for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush
	there came a low hiss -- a horrid cold sound that made
	Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet.  Then inch by inch out of
	the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the big
	black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.
	When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground,
	he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion-tuft
	balances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the
	wicked snake's eyes that never change their expression,
	whatever the snake may be thinking of.
	'Who is Nag?' said he.  '_I_ am Nag.  The great God Brahm put
	his mark upon all our people, when the first cobra spread his
	hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he slept.  Look, and be
	afraid!'
