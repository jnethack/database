robe
	Robes are the only garments, apart from Shirts, ever to have
	sleeves.  They have three uses:
	1.  As the official uniform of Priests, Priestesses, Monks,
	Nuns (see Nunnery), and Wizards.  The OMT [ Official Management
	Term ] prescribed for the Robes of Priests and Nuns is that
	they _fall in severe folds_; of Priestesses that they _float_;
	and of Wizards that they _swirl_.  You can thus see who you
	are dealing with.
	2.  For Kings.  The OMT here is _falling in stately folds_.
	3.  As the garb of Desert Nomads.  [...]
