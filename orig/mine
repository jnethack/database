mine*
gnomish mines
	Made by Dwarfs.  The Rule here is that the Mine is either long
	deserted or at most is inhabited by a few survivors who will
	make confused claims to have been driven out/decimated by humans/
	other Dwarfs/Minions of the Dark Lord.  Inhabited or not, this
	Mine will be very complex, with many levels of galleries,
	beautifully carved and engineered.  What was being mined here
	is not always evident, but at least some of the time it will
	appear to have been Jewels, since it is customary to find
	unwanted emeralds, etc., still embedded in the rock of the
	walls.  Metal will also be present, but only when made up into
	armor and weapons (_wondrous_).
