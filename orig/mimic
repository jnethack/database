*mimic
	The ancestors of the modern day chameleon, these creatures can
	assume the form of anything in their surroundings.  They may
	assume the shape of objects or dungeon features.  Unlike the
	chameleon though, which assumes the shape of another creature
	and goes in hunt of food, the mimic waits patiently for its
	meals to come in search of it.
