quadruped
	The woodlands and other regions are inhabited by multitudes
	of four-legged creatures which cannot be simply classified.
	They might not have fiery breath or deadly stings, but
	adventurers have nevertheless met their end numerous times
	due to the claws, hooves, or bites of such animals.
