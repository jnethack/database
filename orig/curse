curse*
	Curses are longstanding ill-wishings which, in Fantasyland,
	often manifest as semisentient.  They have to be broken or
	dispelled.  The method varies according to the type and
	origin of the Curse:
	[...]
	4.  Curses on Rings and Swords.  You have problems.  Rings
	have to be returned whence they came, preferably at over a
	thousand degrees Fahrenheit, and the Curse means you won't
	want to do this.  Swords usually resist all attempts to
	raise their Curses.  Your best source is to hide the Sword
	or give it to someone you dislike.
