*dragon*scale*
	Stephen had argued, and the expert armorer had grudgingly
	admitted, that dragonscale shield or armor, provided it proved
	feasible to make at all, ought to offer some real, practical
	advantages over any metal breastplate or shield -- gram for
	gram of weight, such a defense would probably be a lot
	tougher and more protective than any human smiths could
	make of steel.
