	With a single, savage thrust of her spear, the warrior-woman 
	impaled the fungus, silencing it.  However, it was too late:  
	the alarm had been raised[...]
	Suddenly, a large, dark shape rose from the abyss before them, 
	its fetid bulk looming overhead...The monster was some kind of
	great dark worm, but that was about all they were sure of.
