panther
	And lo! almost where the ascent began,
	A panther light and swift exceedingly,
	Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!

	And never moved she from before my face,
	Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
	That many times I to return had turned.
		[ Dante's Inferno, as translated
		    by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ]
