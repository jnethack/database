*elemental
	Elementals are manifestations of the basic nature of the
	universe.  There are four known forms of elementals:  air, fire,
	water, and earth.  Some mystics have postulated the necessity
	for a fifth type, the spirit elemental, but none have ever
	been encountered, at least on this plane of existence.
