lord surt*
	Yet first was the world in the southern region, which was
	named Muspell; it is light and hot; that region is glowing
	and burning, and impassable to such as are outlanders and
	have not their holdings there.  He who sits there at the
	land's-end, to defend the land, is called Surtr; he brandishes
	a flaming sword, and at the end of the world he shall go forth
	and harry, and overcome all the gods, and burn all the
	world with fire.
