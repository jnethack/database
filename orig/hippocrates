hippocrates
	Greek physician, recognized as the father of medicine.  He
	is believed to have been born on the island of Cos, to have
	studied under his father, a physician, to have traveled for
	some time, perhaps studying in Athens, and to have then
	returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The
	Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of
	enormous importance in separating medicine from superstition
	and philosophic speculation, placing it on a strictly
	scientific plane based on objective observation and critical
	deductive reasoning.
