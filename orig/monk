	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."
