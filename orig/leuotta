leocrotta
leu*otta
	... the leucrocotta, a wild beast of extraordinary swiftness,
	the size of the wild ass, with the legs of a Stag, the neck,
	tail, and breast of a lion, the head of a badger, a cloven
	hoof, the mouth slit up as far as the ears, and one continuous
	bone instead of teeth; it is said, too, that this animal can
	imitate the human voice.
