wizard of yendor
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
