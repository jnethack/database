	A minute invertebrate animal; one of the class _Insecta_.
	The true insects or hexapods have the body divided into a
	head, a thorax of 3 segments, each of which bears a pair of
	legs, and an abdomen of 7 to 11 segments, and in development
	usually pass through a metamorphosis.  There are usually 2
	pairs of wings, sometimes one pair or none.

	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
	will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
	And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot
	be able to see the earth:  and they shall eat the residue of
	that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail,
	and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
	And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
	servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
	thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
	that they were upon the earth unto this day.  And he turned
	himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
