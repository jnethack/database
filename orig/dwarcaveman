gnom* cave*man
	'Twas in a land unkempt of life's red dawn;
	Where in his sanded cave he dwelt alone;
	Sleeping by day, or sometimes worked upon
	His flint-head arrows and his knives of stone;
	By night stole forth and slew the savage boar,
	So that he loomed a hunter of loud fame,
	And many a skin of wolf and wild-cat wore,
	And counted many a flint-head to his name;
	Wherefore he walked the envy of the band,
	Hated and feared, but matchless in his skill.
	Till lo! one night deep in that shaggy land,
	He tracked a yearling bear and made his kill;
	Then over-worn he rested by a stream,
	And sank into a sleep too deep for dream.
