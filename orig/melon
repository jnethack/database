melon
	"What is it, Umbopa, son of a fool?" I shouted in Zulu.
	"It is food and water, Macumazahn," and again he waved the
	green thing.
	Then I saw what he had got.  It was a melon.  We had hit upon
	a patch of wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.
	"Melons!" I yelled to Good, who was next me; and in another
	second he had his false teeth fixed in one.
	I think we ate about six each before we had done, and, poor
	fruit as they were, I doubt if I ever thought anything nicer.
