	TUBAL:  There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company
	to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
	SHYLOCK:  I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture
	him; I am glad of it.
	TUBAL:  One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
	daughter for a monkey.
	SHYLOCK:  Out upon her!  Thou torturest me, Tubal.  It was my
	turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would
	not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
