goblin
	Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted.  They make
	no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones.  They
	can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled
	dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they are usually
	untidy and dirty.  Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes,
	tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well,
	or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and
	slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and
	light.
