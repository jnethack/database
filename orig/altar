*altar
	Altars are of three types:
	1.  In Temples.  These are for Sacrifices [...].  The stone
	top will have grooves for blood, and the whole will be covered
	with _dry brown stains of a troubling kind_ from former
	Sacrifices.
	[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]

	To every man upon this earth
	Death cometh soon or late;
	And how can man die better
	Than facing fearful odds
	For the ashes of his fathers
	And the temples of his gods?
