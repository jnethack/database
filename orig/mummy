	But for an account of the manner in which the body was
	bandaged, and a list of the unguents and other materials
	employed in the process, and the words of power which were
	spoken as each bandage was laid in its place, we must have
	recourse to a very interesting papyrus which has been edited
	and translated by M. Maspero under the title of Le Rituel de
	l'Embaumement. ...
	Everything that could be done to preserve the body was now
	done, and every member of it was, by means of the words of
	power which changed perishable substances into imperishable,
	protected to all eternity; when the final covering of purple
	or white linen had been fastened upon it, the body was ready
	for the tomb.
