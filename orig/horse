	King Richard III: A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
	Catesby: Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
	King Richard III: Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
	                  And I will stand the hazard of the die:
	                  I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
	                  Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
	                  A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
		[ King Richard III, by William Shakespeare ]
