oilskin cloak
	During our watches below we overhauled our clothes, and made
	and mended everything for bad weather.  Each of us had made
	for himself a suit of oil-cloth or tarpaulin, and these we
	got out, and gave thorough coatings of oil or tar, and hung
	upon the stays to dry.  Our stout boots, too, we covered
	over with a thick mixture of melted grease and tar.  Thus we
	took advantage of the warm sun and fine weather of the
	Pacific to prepare for its other face.
