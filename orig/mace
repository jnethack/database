~*sceptre of might
mace
sceptre
	Originally a club armed with iron, and used in war; now a staff
	of office pertaining to certain dignitaries, as the Speaker of
	the House of Commons, Lord Mayors, Mayors etc.  Both sword and
	mace are symbols of dignity, suited to the times when men went
	about in armour, and sovereigns needed champions to vindicate
	their rights.
