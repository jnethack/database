vortices
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  Though the
	vortices do no damage when touched, they are noted for being
	able to envelop unwary travellers.  The hapless fool thus
	swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from exposure to the
	element the vortex is composed of.
