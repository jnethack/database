vortices
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  They are
	noted for being able to envelop unwary travellers.  The
	hapless fool thus swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from
	exposure to the element the vortex is composed of.
