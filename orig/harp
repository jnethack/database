*harp
	A triangular stringed instrument, often Magic.  Even when not
	Magic, a Harp is surprisingly portable and tough and can be
	carried everywhere on the back of the Bard or Harper in all
	weathers.  A Harp seldom goes out of tune and never warps.
	Its strings break only in very rare instances, usually
	because the Harper is sulking or crossed in love.  This is
	just as well as no one seems to make or sell spare strings.
	  [ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]

	After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: "Wife, wife,
	bring me my golden harp."  So she brought it and put it on
	the table before him.  Then he said: "Sing!" and the golden
	harp sang most beautifully.  And it went on singing till the
	ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
	Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down
	like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the
	table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and
	dashed with it towards the door.  But the harp called out
	quite loud: "Master!  Master!" and the ogre woke up just in
	time to see Jack running off with his harp.
