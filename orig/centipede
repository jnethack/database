centipede
	I observed here, what I had often seen before, that certain
	districts abound in centipedes.  Here they have light
	reddish bodies and blue legs; great myriapedes are seen
	crawling every where.  Although they do no harm, they excite
	in man a feeling of loathing.  Perhaps our appearance
	produces a similar feeling in the elephant and other large
	animals.  Where they have been much disturbed, they
	certainly look upon us with great distrust, as the horrid
	biped that ruins their peace.
