*jack*boot*
	A large boot extending over the knee, acting as protective
	armour for the leg, worn by troopers in the 17th and 18th
	centuries and later.  It is still the type of boot worn by
	the Household Cavalry and was adopted by fishermen and others
	before the advent of gum boots.  Figuratively, _to be under the
	jack-boot_ is to be controlled by a brutal military regime.
