whistle
	There were legends both on the front and on the back of the
	whistle. The one read thus:

	FLA FUR BIS FLE The other: QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT
	'I ought to be able to make it out,' he thought;
	'but I suppose I am a little rusty in my Latin.
	When I come to think of it, I don't believe I even
	know the word for a whistle. The long one does seem
	simple enough. It ought to mean, "Who is this who is coming?"

	Well, the best way to find out is evidently to whistle
	for him.'
