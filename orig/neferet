neferet the green
	Neferet the Green holds office in her hidden tower, only
	reachable by magical means, where she teaches her apprentices
	the enigmatic skills of occultism.  Despite her many years, she
	continues to investigate new spells, especially those involving
	translocation.  It is further rumored that when she was an
	apprentice herself, she accidentally turned her skin green, and
	has kept it that way ever since.
