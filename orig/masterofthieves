master of thieves
	There was a flutter of wings at the window.  Ymor shifted his
	bulk out of the chair and crossed the room, coming back with
	a large raven.  After he'd unfastened the message capsule from
	its leg it flew up to join its fellows lurking among the
	rafters.  Withel regarded it without love.  Ymor's ravens were
	notoriously loyal to their master, to the extent that Withel's
	one attempt to promote himself to the rank of greatest thief
	in Ankh-Morpork had cost their master's right hand man his
	left eye.  But not his life, however.  Ymor never grudged a
	man his ambitions.
