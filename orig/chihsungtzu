chih*sung*tzu
	A character in Chinese mythology noted for bringing about the
	end of a terrible drought which threatened the survival of
	the people.  He achieved this by means of sprinkling the
	earth with water from a bowl, using the branch of a tree to
	do so.  He became the heavenly controller of the rain, and
	lived with other celestial beings in their paradise on Mount
	Kunlun.
