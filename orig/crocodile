	How doth the little crocodile
	    Improve his shining tail,
	And pour the waters of the Nile
	    On every golden scale!

	How cheerfully he seems to grin
	    How neatly spreads his claws,
	And welcomes little fishes in,
	    With gently smiling jaws!
		[ How Doth The Little Crocodile, by Lewis Carroll ]
