	The Book of Three lay closed on the table.  Taran had never
	been allowed to read the volume for himself; now he was sure
	it held more than Dallben chose to tell him.  In the sun-
	filled room, with Dallben still meditating and showing no
	sign of stopping, Taran rose and moved through the shimmering
	beams.  From the forest came the monotonous tick of a beetle.
	His hands reached for the cover.  Taran gasped in pain and
	snatched them away.  They smarted as if each of his fingers
	had been stung by hornets.  He jumped back, stumbled against
	the bench, and dropped to the floor, where he put his fingers
	woefully into his mouth.
	Dallben's eyes blinked open.  He peered at Taran and yawned
	slowly.  "You had better see Coll about a lotion for those
	hands," he advised.  "Otherwise, I shouldn't be surprised if
	they blistered."
