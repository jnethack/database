demogorgon
	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the
	most horrible effects.  He is first mentioned by the 4th-century
	Christian writer, Lactantius, who in doing so broke with the
	superstition that the very reference to Demogorgon by name
	brought death and disaster.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]

	Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can
	spread a quickly fatal illness to his victims while rending
	them.  He is a mighty spellcaster, and he can drain the life
	of mortals with a touch of his tail.
