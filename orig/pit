spiked pit
	Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the
	idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.
	I rushed to its deadly brink.  I threw my straining vision
	below.  The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost
	recesses.  Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to
	comprehend the meaning of what I saw.  At length it forced --
	it wrestled its way into my soul -- it burned itself in upon my
	shuddering reason.  Oh! for a voice to speak! -- oh! horror! --
	oh! any horror but this!
