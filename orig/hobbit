hobbit
	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
	numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
	and quiet and good tilled earth:  a well-ordered and well-
	farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they
	were, as a rule, shy of "the Big Folk", as they call us, and
	now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find.
