expensive camera
	There was a time when Rincewind had quite liked the iconoscope.
	He believed, against all experience, that the world was
	fundamentally understandable, and that if he could only equip
	himself with the right mental toolbox he could take the back off
	and see how it worked.  He was, of course, dead wrong.  The
	iconoscope didn't take pictures by letting light fall onto
	specially treated paper, as he had surmised, but by the far
	simpler method of imprisoning a small demon with a good eye for
	colour and a speedy hand with a paintbrush.  He had been very
	upset to find that out.
