stormbringer
	There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the
	sounds of even this nameless, timeless sea: thin sounds,
	agonized and terrible, for all that they remained remote -
	yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by them; they grew
	louder - pain and despair were there, but terror was
	predominant.
	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had
	heard men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his
	great black battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.
