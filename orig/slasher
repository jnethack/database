	"That dog belonged to a settler who tried to build his cabin
	on the bank of the river a few miles south of the fort,"
	grunted Conan. ...  "We took him to the fort and dressed his
	wounds, but after he recovered he took to the woods and turned
	wild.  -- What now, Slasher, are you hunting the men who
	killed your master?" ...  "Let him come," muttered Conan.
	"He can smell the devils before we can see them." ...
	Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the
	bushes.  They were violently shaken and then the dog slunk
	back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson. ...  "He was a man,"
	said Conan.  "I drink to his shade, and to the shade of the
	dog, who knew no fear."  He quaffed part of the wine, then
	emptied the rest upon the floor, with a curious heathen
	gesture, and smashed the goblet.  "The heads of ten Picts
	shall pay for this, and seven heads for the dog, who was a
	better warrior than many a man."
