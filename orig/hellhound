hell hound*
	But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare,
	and his lips parted in amazement.  At the same instant Lestrade
	gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the
	ground.  I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol,
	my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out
	upon us from the shadows of the fog.  A hound it was, an
	enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes
	have ever seen.  Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes
	glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and
	dewlap were outlined in flickering flame.  Never in the
	delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more
	savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that
	dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall
	of fog.
