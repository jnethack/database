hell hound*
	Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of
	existence brought here in the service of evil beings.  A hell
	hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red-brown fur,
	and red, glowing eyes.  The markings, teeth, and tongue are
	soot black.  It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder
	and has a distinct odour of smoke and sulphur.  The baying
	sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that sends a shiver
	through any who hear them.
