jade*
	Nothing grew among the ruins of the city.  The streets were
	broken and the walls of the houses had fallen, but there were
	no weeds flowering in the cracks and it seemed that the city
	had but recently been brought down by an earthquake.  Only
	one thing still stood intact, towering over the ruins.  It
	was a gigantic statue of white, gray and green jade - the
	statue of a naked youth with a face of almost feminine beauty
	that turned sightless eyes toward the north.
	"The eyes!" Duke Avan Astran said.  "They're gone!"
