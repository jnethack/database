tengu
	The tengu was the most troublesome creature of Japanese
	legend.  Part bird and part man, with red beak for a nose
	and flashing eyes, the tengu was notorious for stirring up
	feuds and prolonging enmity between families.  Indeed, the
	belligerent tengu were supposed to have been man's first
	instructors in the use of arms.
