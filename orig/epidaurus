*epidaurus
	The asclepieion at Epidaurus was the most celebrated healing
	center of the Classical world, the place where ill people went
	in the hope of being cured.  To find out the right cure for
	their ailments, they spent a night in the enkoimitiria, a big
	sleeping hall.  In their dreams, the god himself (Asclepius)
	would advise them what they had to do to regain their health.
	There are also mineral springs in the vicinity which may have
	been used in healing.
