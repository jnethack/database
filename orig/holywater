holy water
	"We want a word with you," said Ligur (in a tone of voice
	intended to imply that "word" was synonymous with "horrifically
	painful eternity"), and the squat demon pushed open the office
	door.
	The bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.
	Drop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and
	spin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like
	that, just nastier.
	The demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke
	oozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.
	Then it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay
	glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking
	like a handful of mashed slugs.
	"Hi," said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,
	and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.
	There are some things that are unthinkable; there are some
	depths that not even demons would believe other demons would
	stoop to.
	". . . Holy water.  You bastard," said Hastur.  "You complete
	_bastard_.  He hadn't never done nothing to _you_."
	"Yet," corrected Crowley.
