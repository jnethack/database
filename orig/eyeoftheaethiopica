eye of the aethiopica
	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries
	it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces
	any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and
	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the
	dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between
	areas.
