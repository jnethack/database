eye of the aethiopica
	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries
	it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces
	any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and
	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the
	dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between
	areas.
# note:  The Eyes of the Overworld is the title of Jack Vance's sequel
# to The Dying Earth and in it the 'Eyes' were separate "cusps" that
# needed to be worn like contact lenses, one on each eyeball.  Wearing
# just one and attempting to look with both eyes caused instant stun.
# And when wearing two you couldn't see normal world, only a projection
# of it that had similar topology but where everything was "better".
# NetHack simplifies things:  a pair of lenses is a single item like
# spectacles (eyeglasses), and the effect of wearing these lenses has
# been changed to be useful to game play (Xray vision).  [The quote is
# not derived from the book.]
