flint*
	An emerald is as green as grass;
	A ruby red as blood;
	A sapphire shines as blue as heaven;
	A flint lies in the mud.

	A diamond is a brilliant stone,
	To catch the world's desire;
	An opal holds a fiery spark;
	But a flint holds fire.
		[ Precious Stones, by Christina Giorgina Rossetti ]
