	At first glance around the corner, I thought it was another
	cockatrice. I had encountered the wretched creatures two or
	three times since leaving the open area. I quickly ducked my
	head back and considered what to do next. My heart had begun
	to thump audibly as I patted my pack to make sure I still had
	the dead lizards at close reach. A check of my attire showed
	no obvious holes or damage. I had to keep moving. One deep
	breath, and a count of three, two, one, and around the corner
	I bolted. But it was no cockatrice! I felt a sudden intense
	searing of the skin around my face, and flames began to leap
	from my pack. I tossed it to the ground, and quickly retreated
	back, around that corner, desperately striving to get out of
	its sight.
