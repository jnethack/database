*piercer
	Ye Piercer doth look like unto a stalactyte, and hangeth
	from the roofs of caves and caverns.  Unto the height of a
	man, and thicker than a man's thigh do they grow, and in
	groups do they hang.  If a creature doth pass beneath them,
	they will by its heat and noise perceive it, and fall upon
	it to kill and devour it, though in any other way they move
	but exceeding slow.
