	there is not one, single, solitary, living thing for it to

	hundred miles to the sea; there's no food. There aren't any
	skua gulls to imitate at this season. There aren't any
	penguins this far inland. There's nothing that can reach the
	sea from this point - except us. We've got brains. We can do
	it. Don't you see - it's got to imitate us - it's got to be one
	of us - that's the only way it can fly an airplane - fly a plane
	for two hours, and rule - be - all Earth's inhabitants. A world
	for the taking - if it imitates us!
