	Less than thirty Cat tribes now survived, roaming the cargo
	decks on their hind legs in a desperate search for food.
	But the food had gone.
	The supplies were finished.
	Weak and ailing, they prayed at the supply hold's silver
	mountains: huge towering acres of metal rocks which, in their
	pagan way, the mutant Cats believed watched over them.
	Amid the wailing and the screeching one Cat stood up and held
	aloft the sacred icon.  The icon which had been passed down
	as holy, and one day would make its use known.
	It was a piece of V-shaped metal with a revolving handle on
	its head.
	He took down a silver rock from the silver mountain, while
	the other Cats cowered and screamed at the blasphemy.
	He placed the icon on the rim of the rock, and turned the
	handle.
	And the handle turned.
	And the rock opened.
	And inside the rock was Alphabetti spaghetti in tomato sauce.
