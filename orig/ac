suit or piece of armor
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another
	boy and me.  He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his
	mother had made him from her hair.  I, on the other hand, had
	a brand new suit of chain mail.  Just before our joust, I asked
	him what he'd do if he made the team.  (I was hoping to be more
	popular with the ladies.)  He said he would be able to save the
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me.  I insisted we swap
	armor.  He was forced to accept, as it would have been an
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor
	class was that day."
