morning star
	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but
	with a large spike on the end and smaller spikes around the
	circumference.  It was also known as the goedendag (from the
	Dutch word for "good day") and the holy water sprinkler (from
	its resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the
	Catholic Mass).  It was used by both cavalry and infantry;
	the horseman's weapon typically had a shorter haft than the
	footman's, which might be up to six feet long.  It came into
	use in the beginning of the 14th century.
	The name "morning star" is often erroneously applied to the
	military flail (also known as the therscol), a similar weapon,
	but with the head attached by a short chain.
