	By that time, Narahara had already slipped his arm from the
	sleeve of his outer robe, drew out his two-and-a-half-foot
	Fujiwara Tadahiro sword, and, brandishing it over his head,
	began barreling toward the foreigners.  In less than a minute,
	he had charged upon them and cut one of them through the torso.
	The man fled, clutching his bulging guts, finally to fall from
	his horse at the foot of a pine tree about a thousand yards
	away.  Kaeda Takeji finished him off.  The other two Englishmen
	were severely wounded as they tried to flee.  Only the woman
	managed to escape virtually unscathed.
