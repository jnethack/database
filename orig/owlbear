owlbear
	Owlbears are probably the crossbreed creation of a demented
	wizard; given the lethal nature of this creation, it is quite
	likely the wizard who created them is no longer alive.  As
	the name might already suggest, owlbears are a cross between
	a giant owl and a bear.  They are covered with fur and
	feathers.
