	...  And then a gnome came by, carrying a bundle, an old
	fellow three times as large as an imp and wearing clothes of
	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.
	'White magic.  Run!'  said the gnome ..

	"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Harry told Ron as
	they crossed the lawn.
	"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron,
	bent double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little
	Santa Clauses with fishing rods..."
	There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered,
	and Ron straightened up.  "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
	"Geroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
	It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus.  It was small and
	leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like
	a potato.  Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him
	with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles
	and turned it upside down.
