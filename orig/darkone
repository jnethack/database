                [ Macbeth, by William Shakespeare ]
dark one
	... But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might
	avail; and those who perceived his shadow spreading over the
	world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and
	he gathered again under his government all the evil things of
	the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or beneath it,
	and the Orcs were at his command and multiplied like flies.
	Thus the Black Years began ...
		[ The Silmarillion, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
