quest
	Many, possibly most, Tours are organized as a Quest.  This
	is like a large-scale treasure hunt, with clues scattered
	all over the continent, a few false leads, Mystical Masters
	as game-show hosts, and the Dark Lord and the Terrain to
	make the Quest interestingly difficult.  [...]
	In order to be assured of your future custom, the Management
	has a further Rule:  Tourists, far from being rewarded for
	achieving their Quest Object, must then go on to conquer
	the Dark Lord or set about Saving the World, or both.  And
	why not?  By then you will have had a lot of practice in
	that sort of thing and, besides, the Quest Object is usually
	designed to help you do it.
