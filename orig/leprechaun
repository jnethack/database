leprechaun
	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.
