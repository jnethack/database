imp
	 ... imps ... little creatures of two feet high that could
	gambol and jump prodigiously; ...
		[ The Charwoman's Shadow, by Lord Dunsany ]

	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from
	hell is hard to make, and many in the Celtic countries as
	well as the English Puritans regarded all fairies as devils.
	The fairies of tradition often hover uneasily between the
	ghostly and the diabolic state.
