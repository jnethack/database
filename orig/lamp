*lamp
	When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed,
	and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the
	garden, which were in reality precious stones.  He then asked
	for some food.

	"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I
	have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it."

	Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
	instead.  As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it
	might fetch a higher price.  Instantly a hideous genie
	appeared, and asked what she would have.  She fainted away,
	but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:
	"Fetch me something to eat!"
