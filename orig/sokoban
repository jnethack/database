sokoban
	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle
	in which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from
	above, and tries to put them in designated locations.  Only one
	box may be pushed at a time, not two, and boxes cannot be pulled.
	As the puzzle would be extremely difficult to create physically,
	it is usually implemented as a video game.

	Sokoban was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was
	published by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in
	Takarazuka, Japan.  Thinking Rabbit also released three sequels:
	Boxxle, Sokoban Perfect and Sokoban Revenge.
