jackal
	In Asiatic folktale, jackal provides for the lion; he scares
	up game, which the lion kills and eats, and receives what is
	left as reward.  In stories from northern India he is
	sometimes termed "minister to the king," i.e. to the lion.
	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen
	the legend of his cowardice.  Jackal's heart must never be
	eaten, for instance, in the belief of peoples indigenous to
	the regions where the jackal abounds. ... In Hausa Negro
	folktale Jackal plays the role of sagacious judge and is
	called "O Learned One of the Forest."  The Bushmen say that
	Jackal goes around behaving the way he does "because he is
	Jackal".
