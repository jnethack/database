kroisos
creosote
	Croesus (in Greek: Kroisos), the wealthy last king of Lydia;
	his empire was destroyed when he attacked Cyrus in 549, after
	the Oracle of Delphi (q.v.) had told him:  "if you attack the
	Persians, you will destroy a mighty empire".  Herodotus
	relates of his legendary conversation with Solon of Athens,
	who impressed upon him that being rich does not imply being
	happy and that no one should be considered fortunate before
	his death.
