	A metal of characteristic yellow colour, the most precious
	metal used as a common commercial medium of exchange.  Symbol,

	and ductile of all metals, and very heavy (sp. gr., 19.3).
	It is quite unalterable by heat, moisture, and most
	corrosive agents, and therefore well suited for its use in
	coin and jewelry.
