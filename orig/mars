mars
	The god of war, and one of the most prominent and worshipped
	gods.  In early Roman history he was a god of spring, growth in
	nature, and fertility, and the protector of cattle.  Mars is
	also mentioned as a chthonic god (earth-god) and this could
	explain why he became a god of death and finally a god of war.
	He is the son of Jupiter and Juno.
