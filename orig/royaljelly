	"'Royal Jelly,'" he read aloud, "'must be a substance of
	tremendous nourishing power, for on this diet alone, the
	honey-bee larva increases in weight fifteen hundred times in
	five days!'"

	"How much?"

	"Fifteen hundred times, Mabel.  And you know what that means
	if you put it in terms of a human being?  It means," he said,
	lowering his voice, leaning forward, fixing her with those
	small pale eyes, "it means that in five days a baby weighing
	seven and a half pounds to start off with would increase in
	weight to five tons!"
