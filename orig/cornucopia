horn of plenty
cornucopia
	The infant Zeus was fed with goat's milk by Amalthea,
	daughter of Melisseus, King of Crete.  Zeus, in gratitude,
	broke off one of the goat's horns, and gave it to Amalthea,
	promising that the possessor should always have in abundance
	everything desired.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]

	When Amalthea's horn
	O'er hill and dale the rose-crowned flora pours,
	And scatters corn and wine, and fruits and flowers.
		[ Os Lusiadas, by Luis Vaz de Camoes ]
