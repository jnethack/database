*paper
	Some players, who unconsciously perceive Paper as weak or a
	sign of surrender, will shy away from using it entirely or
	drop it from their game when they are falling behind.  On the
	other hand, Paper also connects with a player's perceptions
	about writing.  There is a quiet power in the printed word.
	It has the ability to lay off thousands of employees, declare
	war against nations, spread scandal or confess love.  Paper,
	in short, has power over masses.  The fate of the entire world
	is determined by print.  As such, some players perceive Paper
	as a subtle attack, the victory of modern culture over barbarism.
	Such players may use Paper to assert their superiority and dignity.
