potion of sleeping
	On waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had
	first seen the old man of the glen.  He rubbed his eyes -- it
	was a bright sunny morning.  The birds were hopping and
	twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft,
	and breasting the pure mountain breeze.  "Surely," thought Rip,
	"I have not slept here all night."  He recalled the occurrences
	before he fell asleep.  The strange man with a keg of liquor --
	the mountain ravine -- the wild retreat among the rocks -- the
	woe-begone party at ninepins -- the flagon -- "Oh! that flagon!
	that wicked flagon!" thought Rip -- "what excuse shall I make
	to Dame Van Winkle!"
