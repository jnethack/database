*tower
*tower of darkness
	Towers (_brooding_, _dark_) stand alone in Waste Areas and
	almost always belong to Wizards.  All are several stories high,
	round, doorless, virtually windowless, and composed of smooth
	blocks of masonry that make them very hard to climb. [...]
	You will have to go to a Tower and then break into it at some
	point towards the end of your Tour.
