tiger
	1.  A well-known tropical predator (_Felis tigris_): a
	feline.  It has a yellowish skin with darker spots or
	stripes.  2.  Figurative: _a paper tiger_, something that is
	meant to scare, but has no really scaring effect whatsoever,
	(after a statement by Mao Ze Dong, August 1946).
		[ Van Dale's Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal ]

	Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
	In the forests of the night,
	What immortal hand or eye
	Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
		[ The Tyger, by William Blake ]
