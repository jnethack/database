*drum*
	Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and
	some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of
	the wild, weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle,
	but Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, is, doubtless, the only human
	being who ever joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel
	of the Dum-Dum.
		[ Tarzan of the Apes, by Edgar Rice Burroughs ]
