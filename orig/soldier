	The soldiers of Yendor are well-trained in the art of war,
	many trained by the Wizard himself.  Some say the soldiers
	are explorers who were unfortunate enough to be captured,
	and put under the Wizard's spell.  Those who have survived
	encounters with soldiers say they travel together in platoons,
	and are fierce fighters.  Because of the load of their combat
	gear, however, one can usually run away from them, and doing
	so is considered a wise thing.
