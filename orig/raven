raven
	But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
	That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
	Nothing further then he uttered -- not a feather then he fluttered--
	Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown before--
	On the morrow *he* will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
		Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'
				[ The Raven, by Edgar Allan Poe ]
