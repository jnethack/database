titan
	Gaea, mother earth, arose from the Chaos and gave birth to
	Uranus, heaven, who became her consort.  Uranus hated all
	their children, because he feared they might challenge his
	own authority.  Those children, the Titans, the Gigantes,
	and the Cyclops, were banished to the nether world.  Their
	enraged mother eventually released the youngest titan,
	Chronos (time), and encouraged him to castrate his father and
	rule in his place.  Later, he too was challenged by his own
	son, Zeus, and he and his fellow titans were ousted from
	Mount Olympus.
