gold golem
	The bellows he set away from the fire, and gathered all the tools
	wherewith he wrought into a silver chest; and with a sponge wiped
	he his face and his two hands withal, and his mighty neck and
	shaggy breast, and put upon him a tunic, and grasped a stout staff,
	and went forth halting; but there moved swiftly to support their
	lord handmaidens wrought of gold in the semblance of living maids.
	In them is understanding in their hearts, and in them speech and
	strength, and they know cunning handiwork by gift of the immortal
	gods.
		[ The Iliad, by Homer ]
