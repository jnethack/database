*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.
