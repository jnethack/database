*mithril*
	_Mithril_!  All folk desired it.  It could be beaten like
	copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make
	of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel.
	Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty
	of _mithril_ did not tarnish or grow dim.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
