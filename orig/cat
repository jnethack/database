kitten
	Well-known quadruped domestic animal from the family of
	predatory felines (_Felis ochreata domestica_), with a thick,
	soft pelt; often kept as a pet.  Various folklores have the
	cat associated with magic and the gods of ancient Egypt.

	So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people
	awakened at dawn - behold!  Every cat was back at his
	accustomed hearth!  Large and small, black, grey, striped,
	yellow and white, none was missing.  Very sleek and fat did
	the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content.

# this one doesn't work very well for dwarven and gnomish cavemen
