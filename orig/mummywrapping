	He held a white cloth -- it was a serviette he had brought
	with him -- over the lower part of his face, so that his
	mouth and jaws were completely hidden, and that was the
	reason for his muffled voice.  But it was not that which
	startled Mrs. Hall.  It was the fact that all his forehead
	above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
	that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
	lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black
	hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross
	bandages, project in curious tails and horns, giving him
	the strangest appearance conceivable.
