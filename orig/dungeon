dungeon*
	At once as far as Angels kenn he views
	The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
	A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
	As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames
	No light, but rather darkness visible
	Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,
	Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
	And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
	That comes to all; but torture without end
	Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
	With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:
	Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd
	For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd
	In utter darkness, and their portion set
	As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n
	As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.
		[ Paradise Lost, by John Milton ]
