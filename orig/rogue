rogue
* rogue
	I understand the business, I hear it: to have an open ear, a
	quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a
	good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other
	senses.  I see this is the time that the unjust man doth
	thrive.  ...  The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,
	stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels:  if
	I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king
	withal, I would not do't:  I hold it the more knavery to
	conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.
		[ Autolycus the Rogue, from The Winter's Tale by
			William Shakespeare ]
