pony
		Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?
		Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?
		Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,
		White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!

	[...]
	Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and
	stood in a line.  Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.

	"Here are your ponies, now!" he said.  "They've more sense (in some
	ways) than you wandering hobbits have -- more sense in their noses.
	For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they
	run to save themselves, then they run the right way."
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
