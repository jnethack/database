	Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their
	faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.

	-- And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.
	Knife in his back.  Knife like that.

	Whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife,
	quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the
	striking position.

	-- In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two
	smugglers.  Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.
	Like that.  Prepare to meet your God, says he.  Chuck!  It
	went into his back up to the butt.
