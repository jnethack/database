	But as for Queequeg -- why, Queequeg sat there among them --
	at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an
	icicle.  To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.  His
	greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his
	bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it
	there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to
	the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
	beefsteaks towards him.
