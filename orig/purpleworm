*purple worm
	A gargantuan version of the harmless rain-worm, the purple
	worm poses a huge threat to the ordinary adventurer.  It is
	known to swallow whole and digest its victims within only a
	few minutes.  These worms are always on guard, sensitive
	to the most minute vibrations in the earth, but may also
	be awakened by a remote shriek.
