lichen
	The chamber was of unhewn rock, round, as near as might
	be, eighteen or twenty feet across, and gay with rich
	variety of fern and moss and lichen.  The fern was in
	its winter still, or coiling for the spring-tide; but
	moss was in abundant life, some feathering, and some
	gobleted, and some with fringe of red to it.
