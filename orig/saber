*saber
*sabre
	Flashed all their sabres bare,
	Flashed as they turned in air,
	Sab'ring the gunners there,
	Charging an army, while
	All the world wondered:
	Plunged in the battery smoke,
	Right through the line they broke;
	Cossack and Russian
	Reeled from the sabre-stroke
	Shattered and sundered.
	Then they rode back, but not--
	Not the six hundred.
		[ The Charge of the Light Brigade,
		  by Alfred, Lord Tennyson ]
