scorpius
	Since early times, the Scorpion has represented death, darkness,
	and evil.  Scorpius is the reputed slayer of Orion the Hunter.
	[...]  The gods put both scorpion and hunter among the stars, but
	on opposite sides of the sky so they would never fight again.
	As Scorpius rises in the east, Orion sets in the west.
