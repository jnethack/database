major demon
	It is often very hard to discover what any given Demon looks
	like, apart from a general impression of large size, huge
	fangs, staring eyes, many limbs, and an odd color; but all
	accounts agree that Demons are very powerful, very Magic (in
	a nonhuman manner), and made of some substance that can squeeze
	through a keyhole yet not be pierced with a Sword.  This makes
	them difficult to deal with, even on the rare occasions when
	they are friendly.
