sling
	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and
	drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward
	the army to meet the Philistine.
	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
	and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
	the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face
	to the earth.
	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with
	a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there
	was no sword in the hand of David.
