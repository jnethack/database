	[Pestilence:] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,
	and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four
	beasts saying, Come and see.  And I saw, and behold a white
	horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given
	unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

	[War:] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the
	second beast say, Come and see.  And there went out another
	horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon
	to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one
	another: and there was given unto him a great sword.

	[Famine:] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the
	third beast say, Come and see.  And I beheld, and lo a black
	horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his
	hand.  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say,
	A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley
	for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

	[Death:] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the
	voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.  And I looked, and
	behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death,
	and Hell followed with him.  And power was given unto them over
	the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with
	hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
