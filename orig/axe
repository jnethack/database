axe
	"For ev'ry silver ringing blow,
	Cities and palaces shall grow!"

	"Bite deep and wide, O Axe, the tree,
	Tell wider prophecies to me."

	"When rust hath gnaw'd me deep and red,
	A nation strong shall lift his head.

	"His crown the very Heav'ns shall smite,
	Aeons shall build him in his might."

	"Bite deep and wide, O Axe, the tree;
	Bright Seer, help on thy prophecy!"
		[ Malcolm's Katie, by Isabella Valancey Crawford ]
