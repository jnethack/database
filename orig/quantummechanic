	to have strangely derived powers, and unknown motives.

	_Uncertainty Principle_  The principle that it is not possible
	to know with unlimited accuracy both the position and momentum
	of a particle. ... An explanation of the uncertainty is that
	in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must be
	able to bounce off it a photon of radiation; this act of
	location itself alters the position of the particle
	in an unpredictable way.  To locate the position accurately,
	photons of short wavelength would have to be used.  The high
	momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the
	position.  On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta
	would have less effect on the particle's position, but would
	be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.
