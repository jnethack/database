*horn
	Roland hath set the Olifant to his mouth,
	He grasps it well, and with great virtue sounds.
	High are those peaks, afar it rings and loud,
	Thirty great leagues they hear its echoes mount.
	So Charles heard, and all his comrades round;
	Then said that King: "Battle they do, our counts!"
	And Guenelun answered, contrarious:
	"That were a lie, in any other mouth."
