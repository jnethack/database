	I noticed that all the plants were attached to the soil by
	an almost imperceptible bond.  Devoid of roots, they seemed
	not to require any nourishment from sand, soil, or pebble.
	All they required was a point of support -- nothing else.
	These plants are self-propagated, and their existence depends
	entirely on the water that supports and nourishes them.
	Most of them do not sprout leaves, but sprout blades of
	various whimsical shapes, and their colors are limited to
	pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.  I had the
	opportunity to observe once more -- not the dried specimens
	I had studied on the _Nautilus_ -- but the fresh, living
	specimens in their native setting.
