dunce*
	A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's
	cap, or dunce's hat, is a tall conical hat.  In popular
	culture, it is typically made of paper and often marked with
	a D, and given to schoolchildren to wear as punishment for
	being stupid or lazy.  While this is now a rare practice,
	it is frequently depicted in popular culture such as
	children's cartoons.
