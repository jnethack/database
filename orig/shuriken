throwing star
shuriken
	You know, that's what I hate most about fighting against magic:
	you never know what they're trying to do to you until it hits.
	The sorceress knew what hit her, however.  Two of the shuriken
	got past whatever defenses she had.  One caught her just below
	the throat, the other in the middle of her chest.  It wouldn't
	kill her, but she wouldn't be fighting anyone for a while.
