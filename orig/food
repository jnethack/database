*food*
	The little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest
	and biggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground
	and eagerly opened it.  Inside she found, nicely wrapped in
	white papers, a ham sandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle,
	a slice of new cheese and an apple.  Each thing had a separate
	stem, and so had to be picked off the side of the box; but
	Dorothy found them all to be delicious, and she ate every bit
	of luncheon in the box before she had finished.
