raijin
raiden
	The Japanese god of thunder (rai) and lightning (den).  He
	prevented the Mongols from invading Japan in 1274.  Sitting on
	a cloud he sent forth a shower of lightning arrows upon the
	invading fleet.  Only three men escaped.  Raiden is portrayed
	as a red demon with sharp claws, carrying a large drum.  He is
	fond of eating human navels.  The only protection against him
	is to hide under a mosquito net.
