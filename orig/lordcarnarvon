lord carnarvon
	Lord Carnarvon was a personality who could have been produced
	nowhere but in England, a mixture of sportsman and collector,
	gentleman and world traveler, a realist in action and a
	romantic in feeling.  ...  In 1903 he went for the first time
	to Egypt in search of a mild climate and while there visited
	the excavation sites of several archaeological expeditions.
	...  In 1906 he began his own excavations.
