chameleon
	Name of a family (_Chameleonidae_) and race (_Chameleo_) of
	scaly lizards, especially the _Chameleo vulgaris_ species,
	with a short neck, claws, a grasping tail, a long, extendible
	tongue and mutually independent moving eyes.  When it is
	scared or angry, it inflates itself and its transparent skin
	shows its blood:  the skin first appears greenish, then
	gradually changes color until it is a spotted red.  The final
	color depends on the background color as well, hence the
	(figurative) implication of unreliability.  [Capitalized:]
	a constellation of the southern hemisphere (Chameleo).
