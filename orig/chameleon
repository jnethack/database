chameleon
	A small lizard perched on a brown stone.  Feeling threatened by
	the approach of human beings along the path, it metamorphosed
	into a stingray beetle, then into a stench-puffer, then into a
	fiery salamander.
	Bink smiled.  These conversions weren't real.  It had assumed
	the forms of obnoxious little monsters, but not their essence.
	It could not sting, stink or burn.  It was a chameleon, using
	its magic to mimic creatures of genuine threat.
	Yet as it shifted into the form of a basilisk it glared at him
	with such ferocity that Bink's mirth abated.  If its malice
	could strike him, he would be horribly dead.
