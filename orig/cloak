*cloak*
	Cloaks are the universal outer garb of everyone who is not a
	Barbarian.  It is hard to see why.  They are open in front
	and require you at most times to use one hand to hold them
	shut.  On horseback they leave the shirt-sleeved arms and
	most of the torso exposed to wind and Weather.  The OMTs
	[ Official Management Terms ] for Cloaks well express their
	difficulties.  They are constantly _swirling and dripping_
	and becoming _heavy with water_ in rainy Weather, _entangling
	with trees_ or _swords_, or needing to be _pulled close
	around her/his shivering body_.  This seems to suggest they
	are less than practical for anyone on an arduous Tour.
