quetzalcoatl
	One of the principal Aztec-Toltec gods was the great and wise
	Quetzalcoatl, who was called Kukumatz in Guatemala, and
	Kukulcan in Yucatan.  His image, the plumed serpent, is found
	on both the oldest and the most recent Indian edifices. ...
	The legend tells how the Indian deity Quetzalcoatl came from
	the "Land of the Rising Sun".  He wore a long white robe and
	had a beard; he taught the people crafts and customs and laid
	down wise laws.  He created an empire in which the ears of
	corn were as long as men are tall, and caused bolls of colored
	cotton to grow on cotton plants.  But for some reason or other
	he had to leave his empire. ...  But all the legends of
	Quetzalcoatl unanimously agree that he promised to come again.
