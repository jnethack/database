	Rats are long-tailed rodents.  They are aggressive,
	omnivorous, and adaptable, often carrying diseases.

	"The rat," said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible
	audience, "although a rodent, is carnivorous.  You are aware
	of that.  You will have heard of the things that happen in
	the poor quarters of this town.  In some streets a woman dare
	not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes.
	The rats are certain to attack it.  Within quite a small time
	they will strip it to the bones.  They also attack sick or
	dying people.  They show astonishing intelligence in knowing
	when a human being is helpless."
