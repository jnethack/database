sting
	There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about
	him when he came to his senses.  The spider lay dead beside
	him, and his sword-blade was stained black.  Somehow the
	killing of the giant spider, all alone and by himself in the
	dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of
	anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins.  He felt
	a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of
	an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put
	it back into its sheath.
	"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call
	you Sting."
