blindfold
	The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the
	yellowish linen whereof those of the Amahagger who condescended
	to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
	the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
	tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native
	manufacture.  The bandage was then knotted at the back of the
	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also
	blindfolded, I do not know why, unless it was from fear that she
	should impart the secrets of the route to us.
