wraith
nazgul
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
