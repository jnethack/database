lance
	With this the wind increased, and the mill sails began to turn
	about; which Don Quixote espying, said, 'Although thou movest
	more arms than the giant Briareus thou shalt stoop to me.'
	And, after saying this, and commending himself most devoutly
	to his Lady Dulcinea, desiring her to succor him in that trance,
	covering himself well with his buckler, and setting his lance
	on his rest, he spurred on Rozinante, and encountered with the
	first mill that was before him, and, striking his lance into
	the sail, the wind swung it about with such fury, that it broke
	his lance into shivers, carrying him and his horse after it,
	and finally tumbled him a good way off from it on the field in
	evil plight.
