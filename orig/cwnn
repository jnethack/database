cwn*n
	A pack of snow-white, red-eared spectral hounds which
	sometimes took part in the kidnappings and raids the
	inhabitants of the underworld sometimes make on this world
	(the Wild Hunt).  They are associated in Wales with the sounds
	of migrating wild geese, and are said to be leading the souls
	of the damned to hell.  The phantom chase is usually heard or
	seen in midwinter and is accompanied by a howling wind.
