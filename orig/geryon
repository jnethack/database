geryon
	Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,
	His head and upper part expos'd on land,
	But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
	His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
	So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
	The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
	Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,
	And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
	And orbits.  Colours variegated more
	Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
	With interchangeable embroidery wove,
	Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
	As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,
	Stands part in water, part upon the land;
	Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
	The beaver settles watching for his prey;
	So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,
	Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.  In the void
	Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,
	With sting like scorpion's arm'd.  Then thus my guide:
	"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,
	Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."
		[ The Inferno, from The Divine Comedy of Dante
			Alighieri, translated by H.F. Cary ]
