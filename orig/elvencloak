elven cloak
	The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the
	clothes they had brought.  For each they had provided a hood
	and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm
	silken stuff that the Galadrim wove.  It was hard to say of
	what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under
	the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or
	set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or
	brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under
	the stars.
