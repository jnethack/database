orange
pear
	What was the fruit like?  Unfortunately, no one can describe
	a taste.  All I can say is that, compared with those fruits,
	the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and the
	juiciest orange was dry, and the most melting pear was hard
	and woody, and the sweetest wild strawberry was sour.  And
	there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps.  If you had once
	eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would
	taste like medicines after it.  But I can't describe it.  You
	can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that
	country and taste it for yourself.
