elbereth
	... Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear
	voice rose in song.

		A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
		silivren penna miriel
		o menel aglar elenath!
		Na-chaered palan-diriel
		o galadhremmin ennorath,
		Fanuilos, le linnathon
		nef aear, si nef aearon!

	Frodo halted for a moment, looking back.  Elrond was in his
	chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the
	trees.  Near him sat the Lady Arwen.  [...]
	He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the
	elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody.
	"It is a song to Elbereth," said Bilbo.  "They will sing that,
	and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight.
	Come on!"
