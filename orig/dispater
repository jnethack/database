dispater
	The Roman ruler of the underworld and fortune, similar to the
	Greek Hades.  Every hundred years, the Ludi Tarentini were
	celebrated in his honor.  The Gauls regarded Dis Pater as
	their ancestor.  The name is a contraction of the Latin Dives,
	"the wealthy", Dives Pater, "the wealthy father", or "Fater
	Wealth".  It refers to the wealth of precious stone below the
	earth.
