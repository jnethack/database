	"Now, this third handkerchief," Mein Herr proceeded, "has also
	four edges, which you can trace continuously round and round:
	all you need do is to join its four edges to the four edges of
	the opening.  The Purse is then complete, and its outer
	surface--"
	"I see!" Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.  "Its outer surface
	will be continuous with its inner surface!  But it will take
	time. I'll sew it up after tea."  She laid aside the bag, and
	resumed her cup of tea.  "But why do you call it Fortunatus's
	Purse, Mein Herr?"
	The dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking
	more exactly like the Professor than ever.  "Don't you see,
	my child--I should say Miladi?  Whatever is inside that Purse,
	is outside it; and whatever is outside it, is inside it.  So
	you have all the wealth of the world in that leetle Purse!"
