	"Listen, man-cub," said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like
	thunder on a hot night.  "I have taught thee all the Law of
	the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the
	Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.  They have no law.  They
	are outcasts.  They have no speech of their own, but use the
	stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
	and wait up above in the branches.  Their way is not our way.
	They are without leaders.  They have no remembrance.  They
	boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people
	about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of
	a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten.
	We of the jungle have no dealings with them.  We do not drink
	where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go;
	we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die...."
