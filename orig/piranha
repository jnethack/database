piranha
	They live in "schools." Many times they will wait for prey 
	to come to the shallow water of the river. Then the large 
	group of piranhas will attack. These large groups are able 
	to kill large animals... Their lower teeth fit perfectly 
	into the spaces of their upper teeth, creating a tremendous 
	vice-like bite... Piranhas are attracted to any disturbance 
	in the water.
