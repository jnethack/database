marduk
	First insisting on recognition as supreme commander, Marduk
	defeated the Dragon, cut her body in two, and from it created
	heaven and earth, peopling the world with human beings who not
	unnaturally showed intense gratitude for their lives.  The
	gods were also properly grateful, invested him with many
	titles, and eventually permitted themselves to be embodied in
	him, so that he became supreme god, plotting the whole course
	of known life from the paths of the planets to the daily
	events in the lives of men.
