topaz
	Aluminum silicate mineral with either hydroxyl radicals or
	fluorine, Al2SiO4(F,OH)2, used as a gem.  It is commonly
	colorless or some shade of pale yellow to wine-yellow;
	... The stone is transparent with a vitreous luster.  It has
	perfect cleavage on the basal pinacoid, but it is nevertheless
	hard and durable.  The brilliant cut is commonly used.  Topaz
	crystals, which are of the orthorhombic system, occur in highly
	acid igneous rocks, e.g., granites and rhyolites, and in
	metamorphic rocks, e.g., gneisses and schists.
