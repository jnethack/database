gelatinous cube
	Despite its popularity (or perhaps because of it), the
	gelatinous cube is also widely known as one of the sillier
	role-playing monsters.  It is something of a commentary on the
	ubiquity of treasure-laden dungeons in the Dungeons & Dragons
	universe, as the cube is a creature specifically adapted to a
	dungeon ecosystem.  10 feet to the side, it travels through
	standard 10-foot by 10-foot dungeon corridors, cleaning up
	debris and redistributing treasure by excreting indigestible
	metal items.
