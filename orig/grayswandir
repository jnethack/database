grayswandir
	Why had I been wearing Grayswandir?  Would another weapon have
	affected a Logrus-ghost as strongly?  Had it really been my
	father, then, who had brought me here?  And had he felt I might
	need the extra edge his weapon could provide?  I wanted to
	think so, to believe that he had been more than a Pattern-ghost.
