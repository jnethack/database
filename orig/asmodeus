asmodeus
	It is said that Asmodeus is the overlord over all of hell.
	His appearance, unlike many other demons and devils, is
	human apart from his horns and tail.  He can freeze flesh
	with a touch.
		[]

	The evil demon who appears in the Apocryphal book of _Tobit_
	and is derived from the Persian _Aeshma_.  In _Tobit_ Asmodeus
	falls in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and causes the
	death of seven husbands in succession, each on his bridal night.
	He was finally driven from Egypt through a charm made by Tobias
	of the heart and liver of a fish burned on perfumed ashes, as
	described by Milton in _Paradise Lost_ (IV, 167-71).  Hence
	Asmodeus often figures as the spirit of matrimonial jealousy
	or unhappiness.
