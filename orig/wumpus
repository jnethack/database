*wumpus
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.

	_Wumpus yobgregorii_, in the flesh...
	Later, all you will be able to remember are its eyes.  They
	are rich mud-brown, and they hold your own without effort.
