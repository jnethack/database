	[...]  For the two priests were talking exactly like priests,
	piously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial
	enigmas of theology.  The little Essex priest spoke the more
	simply, with his round face turned to the strengthening stars;
	the other talked with his head bowed, as if he were not even
	worthy to look at them.  But no more innocently clerical
	conversation could have been heard in any white Italian cloister
	or black Spanish cathedral.  The first he heard was the tail of
	one of Father Brown's sentences, which ended:  "... what they
	really meant in the Middle Ages by the heavens being
	incorruptible."  The taller priest nodded his bowed head and
	said:  "Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason;
	but who can look at those millions of worlds and not feel that
	there may well be wonderful universes above us where reason is
	utterly unreasonable?"
