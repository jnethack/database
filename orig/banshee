banshee
	In Irish folklore and that of the Western Highlands of Scotland,
	a female fairy who announces her presence by shrieking and
	wailing under the windows of a house when one of its occupants
	is awaiting death.  The word is a phonetic spelling of the
	Irish _beansidhe_, a woman of the fairies.
