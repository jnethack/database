wood golem
	Come, old broomstick, you are needed,
	Take these rags and wrap them round you!
	Long my orders you have heeded,
	By my wishes now I've bound you.
	Have two legs and stand,
	And a head for you.
	Run, and in your hand
	Hold a bucket too.
	...
	See him, toward the shore he's racing
	There, he's at the stream already,
	Back like lightning he is chasing,
	Pouring water fast and steady.
	Once again he hastens!
	How the water spills,
	How the water basins
	Brimming full he fills!
	[ The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
	  translation by Edwin Zeydel ]
