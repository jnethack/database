ma*annan*
	Normally called Manannan, Ler's son was the patron of
	merchants and sailors.  Manannan had a sword which never
	failed to slay, a boat which propelled itself wherever its
	owner wished, a horse which was swifter than the wind, and
	magic armour which no sword could pierce.  He later became
	god of the sea, beneath which he lived in Tir na nOc, the
	underworld.
