goblin king
orcrist
	The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he
	looked at it, and all his soldiers gnashed their teeth,
	clashed their shields, and stamped.  They knew the sword at
	once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when
	the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did
	battle before their walls.  They had called it Orcrist,
	Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter.
	They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.
