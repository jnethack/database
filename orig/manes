manes
	Manes or Di Manes ("good ones") is the euphemistic description
	of the souls of the deceased, worshipped as divinities.  The
	formula D.M. (= Dis Manibus; "dedicated to the Manes-gods")
	can often be found on tombstones.  Manes also means
	metaphorically 'underworld' or 'realm of death'.  Festivals
	in honor of the dead were the Parentalia and the Feralia,
	celebrated in February.

	The gnats of the dungeon, these swarming monsters are rarely
	seen alone.
