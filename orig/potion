*potion*
	POTABLE, n.  Suitable for drinking.  Water is said to be
	potable; indeed, some declare it our natural beverage,
	although even they find it palatable only when suffering
	from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it
	is a medicine.  Upon nothing has so great and diligent
	ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all
	countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the
	invention of substitutes for water.  To hold that this
	general aversion to that liquid has no basis in the
	preservative instinct of the race is to be unscientific --
	and without science we are as the snakes and toads.
