	But as Snow White grew, she became more and more beautiful,
	and by the time she was seven years old she was as beautiful
	as the day and more beautiful than the queen herself.  One
	day when the queen said to her mirror:

		"Mirror, Mirror, here I stand.
		Who is the fairest in the land?" -

	the mirror replied:

		"You, O Queen, are the fairest here,
		But Snow White is a thousand times more fair."
		[ Snow White, by Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm ]
