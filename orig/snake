	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
	which the Lord God had made.  And he said unto the woman, Yea,
	hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
	the trees of the garden:  but of the fruit of the tree which is
	in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of
	it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent
	said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth
	know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
	opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And
	when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
	was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
	wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
	unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

	And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
	hast done?  And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
	did eat.  And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou
	hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above
	every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
	dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  And I will put
	enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
	seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
