*norn
	The Norns were the three Norse Fates, or the goddesses of fate.
	Female giants, they brought the wonderful Golden Age to an end.
	They cast lots over the cradle of every child that was born,
	and placed gifts in the cradle.  Their names were Urda,
	Verdandi, and Skuld, representing the past, the present, and
	the future.  Urda and Verdandi were kindly disposed, but Skuld
	was cruel and savage.  Their tasks were to sew the web of
	fate, to water the sacred ash, Yggdrasil, and to keep it in
	good condition by placing fresh earth around it daily.  In her
	fury, Skuld often spoiled the work of her sisters by tearing
	the web to shreds.
