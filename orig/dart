dart*
	Darts are missile weapons, designed to fly such that a sharp,
	often weighted point will strike first.  They can be
	distinguished from javelins by fletching (i.e., feathers on
	the tail) and a shaft that is shorter and/or more flexible,
	and from arrows by the fact that they are not of the right
	length to use with a normal bow.
		[ Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]

	Against my foe I hurled a murderous dart.
	He caught it in his hand -- I heard him laugh --
	I saw the thing that should have pierced his heart
	Turn to a golden staff.
		[ Gifts, by Mary Coleridge ]
