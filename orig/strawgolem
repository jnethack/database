straw golem
	Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully
	at the Scarecrow.  Its head was a small sack stuffed with
	straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent
	a face.  An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some
	Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure
	was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also
	been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old boots with
	blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the
	figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the
	pole stuck up its back.
