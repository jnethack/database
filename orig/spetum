	Many of the weapons of the Middle Ages were poled or long-shafted
	arms.  Unlike the ancient spear or javelin, however, they were not
	intended to be thrown.  Some were devices with simple single- or
	double-edged blades and nothing more, while others combined
	the pick, spear, and hammer or axe all in one weapon.
