	So they stood, each in his place, neither moving a finger's
	breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given
	and received by each in that time, till here and there were
	sore bones and bumps, yet neither thought of crying "Enough,"
	or seemed likely to fall from off the bridge.  Now and then
	they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen
	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his
	jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd
	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but
	the stranger warded the blow, and once again thwacked Robin,
	and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the
	water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.
