	the signs of the zodiac embroidered over it, with various
	cabalistic signs, such as triangles with eyes in them, queer
	crosses, leaves of trees, bones of birds and animals, and a
	planetarium whose stars shone like bits of looking-glass with
	the sun on them.  He had a pointed hat like a dunce's cap, or

	the ladies were accustomed to have a bit of veil floating
	from the top of it.

	pretty much that, tall and cone-shaped with stars and crescent
	moons all over it.  All in all, it couldn't have been more
	wizardish.
