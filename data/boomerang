boomerang
ブーメラン
#(**未**): 
	Rincewind pulled himself up and thought about reaching for his
	stick.  And then he thought again.  The man had a couple of spears
	stuck in the ground, and people here were good at spears, because
	if you didn't get efficient at hitting the things that moved fast
	you had to eat the things that moved slowly.  He was also holding
	a boomerang, and it wasn't one of those toy ones that came back.
	This was one of the big, heavy, gently curved sort that didn't
	come back because it was sticking in something's ribcage.  You
	could laugh at the idea of wooden weapons until you saw the kind
	of wood that grew here.
