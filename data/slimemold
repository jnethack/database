slime mold
変形菌
ねばねばカビ
	Science fiction did not invent the slime molds, but it has
	borrowed from them in using the idea of sheets of liquid, flowing
	cytoplasm engulfing and dissolving every living thing they touch.
	What fiction can only imagine, nature has produced, and only their
	small size and dependence on coolness, moisture, and darkness has
	kept the slime molds from ordinary observation, for they are common
	enough.
