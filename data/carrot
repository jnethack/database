carrot
にんじん
#(**未**): 
	In World War II, Britain's air ministry spread the word that
	a diet of these vegetables helped pilots see Nazi bombers
	attacking at night.  That was a lie intended to cover the real
	matter of what was underpinning the Royal Air Force's successes:
	Airborne Interception Radar, also known as AI. ... British
	Intelligence didn't want the Germans to find out about the
	superior new technology helping protect the nation, so they
	created a rumor to afford a somewhat plausible-sounding
	explanation for the sudden increase in bombers being shot down.
	... The disinformation was so persuasive that the English public
	took to eating carrots to help them find their way during the
	blackouts.
