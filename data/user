#(**未**): 
	Be bold,
	be bold,
	but not too bold.
	Or else your life's blood,
	shall run cold.
		[ The White Road, by Neil Gaiman ]

	People think I'm crazy to worry all the time;
	If you paid attention, you'd be worried too.
	You better pay attention, or this world we love so much
	Might just kill you.
		[ It's a Jungle Out There, by Randy Newman ]
#			[ theme song from "Monk" ]
