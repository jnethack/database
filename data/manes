manes
	Manes or Di Manes ("good ones") is the euphemistic description
	of the souls of the deceased, worshipped as divinities.  The
	formula D.M. (= Dis Manibus; "dedicated to the Manes-gods")
	can often be found on tombstones.  Manes also means
	metaphorically 'underworld' or 'realm of death'.  Festivals
	in honor of the dead were the Parentalia and the Feralia,
	celebrated in February.
