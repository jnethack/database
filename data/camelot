camelot*
キャメロット*
#(**未**): 
	The seat of Arthur's power in medieval romance.  The name is
	of unknown origin and refers to the castle but also includes
	the surrounding town.  ...  Camelot appears, most significantly,
	as a personal capital as opposed to a permanent or national
	one.  It is Arthur's and Arthur's alone.  There are no previous
	lords and Arthur's successor, Constantine, does not take up
	residence there.  Camelot is actually said to have been
	demolished after Arthur and Lancelot were gone by Mark.  Fazio
	degli Uberti, the Italian poet, claims to have seen the ruins
	in the 14th century.
