アスモデウス
	アスモデウスは，地獄全体の総支配者であると言われている．その
	外見は，他の悪魔と違い，角と尻尾以外は人間と同じである．触ら
	れると，肉体は凍りついてしまう．
		[]

	The evil demon who appears in the Apocryphal book of _Tobit_
	and is derived from the Persian _Aeshma_.  In _Tobit_ Asmodeus
	falls in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and causes the
	death of seven husbands in succession, each on his bridal night.
	He was finally driven from Egypt through a charm made by Tobias
	of the heart and liver of a fish burned on perfumed ashes, as
	described by Milton in _Paradise Lost_ (IV, 167-71).  Hence
	Asmodeus often figures as the spirit of matrimonial jealousy
	or unhappiness.
