python
ニシキヘビ
	A monstrous serpent in Greek mythology, and the child of Gaia,
	the goddess earth.  It was produced from the slime and mud
	that was left on the earth by the great flood of Deucalion.
	It lived in a cave and guarded the oracle of Delphi on mount
	Parnassus.

	No man dared to approach the beast and the people asked Apollo
	for help.  He came down from Mount Olympus with his silver bow
	and golden arrows.  With using only one arrow he killed the
	serpent and claimed the oracle for himself. ... The old name of
	Delphi, Pytho, refers to the serpent.
