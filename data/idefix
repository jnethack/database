idefix
イデフィクス
#(**未**): 
	Another clever translation [of the _Asterix_ character names]
	is that of Idefix.  An _idee fixe_ is a "fixed idea", i.e.
	an obsession, a dogma.  The translation, Dogmatix, manages to
	conserve the "fixed idea" meaning and also include the syllable
	dog -- perfect, given that the character is a dog who has very
	strong views on the environment (he howls whenever he sees an
	uprooted tree).
