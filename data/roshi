roshi
	Roshi is a Japanese word, common in Zen Buddhism, meaning "old"
	(ro) and "teacher" (shi).  Roshi can be used as a term of
	respect, as in the Rinzai school; as a simple reference to
	actual age, as in the Soto school; or it can mean a teacher who
	has transmitted knowledge to, and thus "given birth" to, a new
	teacher.
