magic mirror of merlin
マーリンの魔法の鏡
#(**未**): 妖精の女王, エドマンド・スペンサー
	  [...] In Dehenbarth (that now South Wales is hight,
	  What time King Ryence reigned, and dealed right)
	  The great magician Merlin had devised,
	  By his deep science, and hell-dreaded might,
	  A looking-glass, right wondrously aguised,
	Whose virtues through the wide world soon were solemnized.

	It virtue had to show in perfect sight
	  Whatever thing was in the world contained,
	  Betwixt the lowest earth and heaven's height,
	  So that it to the looker appertained;
	  Whatever foe had wrought, or friend had fained,
	  Therein discovered was, nor aught might pass,
	  Nor aught in secret from the same remained;
# we'll leave out the part about it being a crystal ball...
#	  For-thy it round and hollow shaped was,
#	Like the world itself, and seemed a world of glass.
		[ The Faerie Queene, by Edmund Spencer ]
