ダイ*モンド
#(**未**):

	It is an allotropic form of pure carbon that has crystallized in
	the cubic system, usually as octahedra or cubes, under great
	pressure.
		[ A Concise Dictionary of Physics ]

#(**未**): 
	The diamond, _adamas_ or _dyamas_, is a transparent stone, like
	crystal, but having the colour of polished iron, but it cannot
	be destroyed by iron, fire or any other means, unless it is
	placed in the hot blood of a goat; with sharp pieces of diamond
	other stones are engraved and polished.  It is no greater than
	a small nut.  There are six kinds, however Adamant attracts
	metal; it expels venom; it produces amber (and is efficacious
	against empty fears and for those resisting spells).  It is
	found in India, in Greece and in Cyprus, where magicians make
	use of it.  It gives you courage; it averts apparitions; it
	removes anger and quarrels; it heals the mad; it defends you
	from your enemies.  It should be set in gold or silver and worn
	on the left arm.  It is likewise found in Arabia.
