#(**未**): [3.6.6] ドラキュラ，ブラム・ストーカー
	He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship
	arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
	bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as
	friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my
	friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come
	in mist which he create--that noble ship's captain proved him
	of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this
	mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on
	moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
	sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we
	ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a
	hairbreadth space at the tomb door.
