レムレース
	The Larvae (Lemures) are Roman spirits of deceased family
	members.  These malignant spirits dwell throughout the house
	and frighten the inhabitants.  People tried to reconcile or
	avert the Larvae with strange ceremonies which took place on
	May 9, 11, and 13; this was called the "Feast of the Lemures".
	The master of the house usually performed these ceremonies,
	either by offering black beans to the spirits or chasing them
	away by making a lot of noise.  Their counterparts are the
	Lares, friendly and beneficent house spirits.
