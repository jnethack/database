# note:  The Eyes of the Overworld is the title of Jack Vance's sequel
# to The Dying Earth and in it the 'Eyes' were separate "cusps" that
# needed to be worn like contact lenses, one on each eyeball.  Wearing
# just one and attempting to look with both eyes caused instant stun.
# And when wearing two you couldn't see normal world, only a projection
# of it that had similar topology but where everything was "better".
# NetHack simplifies things:  a pair of lenses is a single item like
# spectacles (eyeglasses), and the effect of wearing these lenses has
# been changed to be useful to game play (Xray vision).  [The quote is
# not derived from the book.]
