dwarven root
	But when they were cooked these roots proved good to eat,
	somewhat like bread; and the outlaws were glad of them, for
	they had long lacked bread save when they could steal it.
	"Wild Elves know them not; Grey-elves have not found them;
	the proud ones from over the Sea are too proud to delve,"
	said Mim.
	
	"What is their name?" said Turin. Mim looked at him sidelong.
	"They have no name, save in the Dwarf-tongue, which we do not
	teach," he said. "And we not teach Men to find them, for Men
	are greedy and thriftless, and would not spare till all the
	plants had perished; whereas now they pass them by as they go
	blundering in the wild. No more will you learn of me; but you
	may have enough of my bounty, as long as you speak fair and
	do not spy or steal." Then again he laughed in his throat.
	
	"They are of great worth." he said. "More than gold in the
	hungry winter, for they may be hoarded like the nuts of a
	squirrel, and already we were building our store from the
	first that are ripe."
