clay golem
	It was a warm spring night when a fist knocked at the door so
	hard that the hinges bent.
	A man opened it and peered out into the street. There was
	mist coming off the river and it was a cloudy night. He might
	as well have tried to see through white velvet.
	But he thought afterwards that there had been shapes out
	there, just beyond the light spilling out into the road. A
	lot of shapes, watching him carefully. He thought maybe
	there'd been very faint points of light...
	There was no mistaking the shape right in front of him,
	though. It was big and dark red and looked like a child's
	clay model of a man. Its eyes were two embers.
