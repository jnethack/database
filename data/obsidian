obsidian*
Йѕ*Ра*
	A volcanic glass, homogeneous in texture and having a low water
	content, with a vitreous luster and a conchoidal fracture.  The
	color is commonly black, but may be some shade of red or brown,
	and cut sections sometimes appear to be green.  Like other
	volcanic glasses, obsidian is a lava that has cooled too quickly
	for the contained minerals to crystallize.  In chemical
	composition it is rich in silica and similar to granite.  It is
	favored by primitive peoples for knives, arrowheads, spearheads,
	and other weapons and tools.
