water troll
水のトロル
#(**未**): [3.6.6] [ ディスクワールド騒動記，安田均訳，角川文庫 ]
	It wasn't that the troll was _horrifying_. Instead of the
	rotting, betentacled monstrosity he had been expecting
	Rincewind found himself looking at a rather squat but not
	particularly ugly old man who would quite easily have passed
	for normal on any city street, always provided that other
	people on the street were used to seeing old men who were
	apparently composed of water and very little else. It was as
	if the ocean had decided to create life without going through
	all that tedious business of evolution, and had simply formed
	a part of itself into a biped and sent it walking squishily up
	the beach. The troll was a pleasant translucent blue color.
	As Rincewind stared a small shoal of silver fish flashed
	across its chest.
