	Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz and a subvariety
	of chalcedony.  Agates are identical in chemical structure to
	jasper, flint, chert, petrified wood, and tiger's-eye, and are
	often found in association with opal.  The colorful, banded rocks
	are used as a semiprecious gemstone and in the manufacture of
	grinding equipment.  An agate's banding forms as silica from
	solution is slowly deposited into cavities and veins in older
	rock.
