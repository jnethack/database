seth
¥»¥È
	The ancient Egyptian god of chaos (Set), the embodiment of
	hostility and even of outright evil.  He is also a god of war,
	deserts, storms, and foreign lands. ... In the Book of the
	Dead, Seth is called "Lord of the Northern Sky" and is held
	responsible for storms and cloudy weather. ... Seth was
	portrayed as a man with the head of undeterminable origin,
	although some see in it the head of an aardvark.  He had a
	curved snout, erect square-tipped ears and a long forked tail.
	He was sometimes entirely in animal form with the body similar
	to that of a greyhound.  Animals sacred to this god were the
	dog, the jackal, the gazelle, the donkey, the crocodile, the
	hippopotamus, and the pig.
