dilithium*
ディリジウム*
#(**未**): 
	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary
	"minerals" of Star Trek is dilithium. ... Because of this
	mineral's central role in the storyline, a whole mythology
	surrounds it.  It is, however, a naturally occurring substance
	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort.  That said, the real mineral that
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate.
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27.
	A mineral with this composition could theoretically exist,
	although it is doubtful that it would possess the more fantastic
	properties ascribed to dilithium.
