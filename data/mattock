*mattock
ドワーフのつるはし
	A mattock is an agricultural tool similar to a mining pick.
	It is distinguished by the head terminating in a broader blade
	rather than a narrow spike, which makes it particularly suitable
	for breaking up moderately hard ground. ... During the Middle
	Ages of Europe, the mattock served as an improvised shafted
	weapon for the poorer classes.
