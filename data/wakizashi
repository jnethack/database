wakizashi
ÏÆº¹¤·
	A wakizashi was used as a samurai's weapon when the katana
	was unavailable.  When entering a building, a samurai would
	leave his katana on a rack near the entrance.  However, the
	wakizashi would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made
	a sidearm for the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a
	pistol).  The samurai would have worn it from the time they
	awoke to the time they went to sleep.  In earlier periods,
	and especially during times of civil wars, a tanto was worn
	in place of a wakizashi.
