demogorgon
デモゴルゴン
	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the
	most horrible effects.  He is first mentioned by the 4th-century
	Christian writer, Lactantius, who in doing so broke with the
	superstition that the very reference to Demogorgon by name
	brought death and disaster.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]

	デモゴルゴンは悪魔の皇子で，汚物にまみれ，犠牲者を速やかに死
	に至らせる毒を撒き散らす．強力な魔術師でもあり，人間の生命を，
	尻尾で触れることにより吸いとることができる．
